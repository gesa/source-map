This document explains how to generate a PDF version of the spec

1. Open ./cover.odt, adjust the year, and print it as PDF.
2. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./ecma-style/ecma.css">` to the bikeshed
   document.
3. View the print preview of the specification as PDF from a browser
   - If needed, add `break-before`/`break-after`/`break-inside` CSS rules to
     specific elements to ensure that page breaks are inserted in the right
     places.
4. Print as PDF the pages containing the "Table of Contents", "Introduction",
   and "copyright notice". Also include the empty page after the copyright.
   - Make sure that the copyright notice is on an _odd_ page, by toggling
     `display: none` on `#copyright-before`.
   - Using https://tools.pdf24.org/en/overlay-pdf, overlay the
     ./headers-and-footers-roman.pdf on top of the generated PDF to add
     headers and footers.
5. Print as PDF pages from the one containing the "Scope" section to the end
   - Using https://tools.pdf24.org/en/overlay-pdf, overlay the
     ./headers-and-footers-numbers.pdf on top of the generated PDF to add
     headers and footers.
6. Using https://pdfjoiner.com/, merge the 3 PDFs obtained at the previous
   steps.

This has been verified using Firefox. Results with different browsers may vary.

The files ./headers-and-footers-numbers.pdf and ./headers-and-footers-roman.pdf
have been generated by adding a lot of empty pages in the template for
specifications from the Ecma drive.
